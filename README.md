## Introduction

Working with many musicians over the years I've learned that most of them have caviar dreams and saltine budgets. I get it. You want to impress but until your band gets better known you only have side-gig cash. I was there too when my bands needed to get info out to A&R, fans, publications, and promoters. Stuffing envelopes and skipping dinner to buy stamps was no fun.

With the advent of the interwebs, musicians have the opportunity to create a web presence to serve the same purpose as the old fashioned photo, bio, cassettes of the olden times. Sadly, many bands choose to use either out-dated fussy technology, over-priced page builder services, or worse they ask their designer/developer friends to spin them off something for beer money.

This project is intended to be a good starting point for the beer money situation.

## User Story

This project is meant to be a starting point for any band that needs an online press kit (aka EPK, electronic press kit) but has a member or a friend with basic front-end web knowledge such as how to edit HTML and CSS, or how to upload to a web server. You should be able to clone this repo, swap out some images and copy, and upload to your server with minimal fuss. Ideally the end user should not need to rewrite any javascript unless they choose to.

We will, over time, include some shiny fun stuff that would otherwise be a pain to develop from scratch like scrolling hero images in the header (first section), a working contact form that includes anti-spam API, and an audio player for local files without having to link to exterior sources. New functionality will be added to the below [to-do list](#to-do-list) as I dream them up or as they are suggested.

## To Do List

- Scrolling hero images from json doc for <header> section.
- Audio player with play, pause, track name, artist name.
- Contact form for fans, promoters, and publisher connections.
- Add hosting options to README.md.
- Add exterior music archive APIs.

## License

TBD but probably MIT or GNU. ðŸŽ‰ So spice.
